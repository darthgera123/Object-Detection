# Object-Detection
This repo contains some of my experiments with object detection algorithms. This contains notebooks using different libraries such as [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and other custom implementations. It will also include some useful articles for building such a system.
